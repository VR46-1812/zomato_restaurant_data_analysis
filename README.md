##Problem Statemen
Zomato, a leading food delivery platform, caters to millions of customers each month, connecting them with a vast network of restaurant partners. With an average of 17.5 million monthly transacting customers and a year-on-year increase in the number of restaurant partners, it's crucial to understand customer preferences, restaurant performance, and trends in ordering behavior.
The task is to analyze a dataset containing information about customers, their orders, and the restaurants they choose. The goal of this analysis is to answer the following key business questions:


1) What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
2) How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
3) What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
4) Zomato has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their average spending on each order?
5) Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
6) Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide those customers with some good offers

##Objectives

1) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1.1) Understand the data structure, clean the data, and prepare it for analysis.
1.2) Generate insights from the data using statistical summaries and visualizations.

2)Answer Key Business Questions:

Utilize the cleaned dataset to answer the specified questions, providing actionable insights for Zomato's business strategy.

3)Data Visualization:

Create visualizations to support your findings and to make the results easily interpretable.

Handle missing or inconsistent data (e.g., cleaning rating values, handling missing votes, etc.).
Convert and format necessary columns for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the distribution of different types of restaurants on the platform.

4. Data Visualization
Use visualizations (e.g., bar plots, histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps) to present findings.
Ensure that each business question is supported by clear, relevant visualizations.

5. Documentation and Reporting
Summarize the findings in a clear and concise report.
Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
